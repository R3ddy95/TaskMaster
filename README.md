# Task Masters ✔️ 
TaskMaster is a To-Do application built using React. It allows users to create a list of tasks they need to complete. Additionally, the app features a Dark Mode that changes the visual style of the entire app, providing a more comfortable experience in low-light conditions.


## How it works
You can add tasks, mark them as completed (by clicking on the text once), and remove them.
